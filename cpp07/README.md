# Cpp Module 07

This module of 42 school's C++ piscine is all about C++ templates.

## Status
Validated 05/01/2023. Grade: 100%.

## Ex00 - Swap, Min & Max
In the first exercise, we must create simple template functions. These are swap, which swaps the values of two given arguments, min which returns the smallest of two arguments, and max which does the opposite. These functions can be called with any type of argument, be it an int, a float, a char, a string, etc.

### Usage
Clone this repository and `cd` into `cpp07/ex00`. Then `make` to compile. Run the program with:

```
./whatever
```
The output shows the results of functionality tests.

## Ex01 - Iter
For the second exercise, we must implement a function template able to call a function on every element of an array. The array can be of any type.

### Usage
Clone this repository and `cd` into `cpp07/ex01`. Then `make` to compile. Run the program with:

```
./iter
```

## Ex02 - Array
For the third exercise, we must implement a class template Array, which contains elements of type T. Memory must be allocated and a subscript operator [] must be defined to access array elements. Of course, this class should work with any variable type (int, char, string, float, etc.)

### Usage
Clone this repository and `cd` into `cpp07/ex02`. Then `make` to compile. Run the program with:

```
./array_template
```
