# Cpp Module 08

This module of 42 school's C++ piscine explores templated containers, iterators, and algorithms. The use of STL and related algorithms is highly encouraged in this module.

## Status
Awaiting evaluation. Grade: ??%.

## Ex00 - Easyfind
In the first exercise, we must create a simple template function, easyfind, which finds the first occurence of an integer in a container, whether it be a vector, a deque, a list...

### Usage
Clone this repository and `cd` into `cpp08/ex00`. Then `make` to compile. Run the program with:

```
./easyfind
```
The output shows the results of functionality tests.

## Ex01 - Span
In the second exercise, we must implement a Span class that can store integers. Using iterators and algorithm functions, it must be able to add a number or a range of numbers to its container. It must also be able to calculate the shortest and the longest span within the numbers it stores.

### Usage
Clone this repository and `cd` into `cpp08/ex01`. Then `make` to compile. Run the program with:

```
./span
```

## Ex02 - MutantStack
The third exercise requires us to create a new container called MutantStack, which adds iterator functionality to the standard `std::stack` container.

### Usage
Clone this repository and `cd` into `cpp08/ex02`. Then `make` to compile. Run the program with:

```
./mutantStack
```
